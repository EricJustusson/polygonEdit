Things fixed:

* Provide a darker fill for the Polygon once it is closed and on the Polygon mousemove event.

* Changed the cursor back to a hand once a Polygon is closed.

* When the Polygon is closed, the button to draw a polygon disappears and only the close polygon button appears (Fixed the button flashing on map drag)

* When you click on "Clear Polygon", the button to draw a polygon appears (to the left of "Clear Polygon")



STILL needs to be fixed:

* When you click on "Clear Polygon", the "clear polygon" button should disappear and the drawing button should appear. Right now, they're both appearing at all times.

* When you close the initial Polygon shape and start creating a second one, the grey followLine is still not appearing.
