Things fixed:

* Provide a darker fill for the Polygon once it is closed and on the Polygon mousemove event.

* Changed the cursor back to a hand once a Polygon is closed.

* When the Polygon is closed, the button to draw a polygon disappears and only the close polygon button appears (Fixed the button flashing on map drag)

* When you press clear, the Polygon disappears and you only see the drawing button.

* When you draw a fully closed Polygon, the drawing button disappears and the "clear polygon" button appears again.

* When you close the initial Polygon shape and start creating a second one, the grey followLine is still not appearing.

* Tooltip to tell the user to click the first point they made on the map to successfully close the Polygon and get the "clear polygon" button.

* Only show tooltip when a user creates a point on the map. Remove tooltip when the Polygon is closed.

* Custom cursor with 'css/crosshairs.png' image


STILL needs to be fixed:

* When you start creating points, the cursor changes between the custom crosshair one and the pointer, creates a kind of weird flashing effect
